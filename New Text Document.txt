Changes Made:
Improved error handling (server.js):
More specific error messages indicating which environment variables are missing
Detailed logging for debugging
Error response includes details about missing variables
Added startup checks (server.js):
Logs warnings at server startup if environment variables are missing
Provides instructions on where to configure them in Coolify
Updated README:
Added Coolify deployment instructions
Added troubleshooting section for Coolify-specific issues
How to Fix the Issue:
In Coolify, set these environment variables:
Go to your application settings in Coolify
Navigate to Environment Variables
Add:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = your Telegram bot token
ADMIN_CHAT_ID = your Telegram chat ID
PORT = 3000 (optional, defaults to 3000)
After adding the variables, restart/redeploy your application
Check the application logs in Coolify — you should see:
✓ TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is set
✓ ADMIN_CHAT_ID is set
If variables are missing, you'll see warnings in the logs.
Next Steps:
Commit and push these changes to your repository
Set the environment variables in Coolify
Redeploy/restart the application
Try registering again — it should work now
The error message will now be more descriptive if variables are still missing, making it easier to diagnose.
